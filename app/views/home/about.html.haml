        About us
      %p 
        We are a team of developers (
        %a{:href  => "http://www.twitter.com/zaiste"} @zaiste
        &
        %a{:href => "http://www..twitter.com/albanlv"}@albanlv
        ) and we have been free-lancing for a few monthes, before founding an
        %a{:href => "http://www.nukomeet.com"} open company.
        We work from home, coworking spaces, cafés, airports... wherever you can find a decent wi-fi. We are nomads who like to work in different places. It helps us to boost our creativity, to meet new people, and to get a fresh view point on our problems. We enjoy to work to have as well as working in group and connect with like-minded individuals.

        Our story
      %p 
        Because we were always hunting for new places to work, we started with a simple idea (that came from our friend 
        %a{:href => "http://www.twitter.com/ecolepublique"} @ecolepublique
        ) we just gathered adresses of cool cafés in Paris, were the wi-fi is decent and waiters are not assholes (both conditions are hard to find in the same place). Then, the idea came to us : why not open our own homes to other free-lancers/independent/entrepreneurs/squirrels and go to their places? That's how the legend was born.

        Where we are now
      %p
        The app is not polished, it is not perfect, and we could add a lot of features, but it does what we wanted to : display a map with the open workplaces and the contact to get there.
      %p
        We wanted to connect the app to couchsurfing, so you can automatically fill a profile and display your level of trust (number of recommendations), but unfortunately there is no proper API to do that.
      %p
        We think there is a lot of potential in this idea, we believe in a world in which people will enjoy their work, work anywhere and use it to connect to other people and have fun. This is why we open-sourced the project. You can find it 
        %a{:href => "http://www.github.com/zaiste/coworfing"} here 
        and contribute.
